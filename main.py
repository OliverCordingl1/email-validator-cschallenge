Computer Science Programming Project - Email Validator

Works by validating the email against a series of regular expressions

parser.add_argument('-A', '--address', help='Email address to validate') # The email address to validate (ignored if the list argument is passed)

    # /^[\w-\.\d]+@([\w-]+\.)+[\w-]{1,24}$/g
    # [\w-\.0-9]   : allow all 'sentence' letters, a-z A-Z, allow '.' and 0-9. There are many other allowed characters but these are being ignored for the sake of simplicity.
    # ([\w-\d]+\.) : allow all 'sentence' characters for first part of domain, and enforce a '.'
    # +[\w]{1,24}  : for the TLD, allow all sentence characters, with a minimum of 2 characters and a max of 24. The minimum character for a TLD is *technically* 0, however anything less than 2 is rare, and the longest TLD that exists is 24 characters
